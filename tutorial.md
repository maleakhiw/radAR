### Tracking Groups
A "Tracking Group" is just a group for the locations tracking/navigation/AR features of the application. Use tracking groups to plan meetups on Chat, set where to meet and track the location of the active (tracking) group members.

1. The Tracking Groups feature works very similarly to Chats. You can create a new Tracking Group from the home screen by searching for a location and selecting it, or by tapping on New Group in the Add (+) menu button in the home screen. Otherwise, simply tap on the Add (+) button in the `Groups` screen.
2. The New Groups screen will show up. As with chats, give the group the name, select the people you want invited to the group and tap on Done once you're done.
3. You are now in the Group. To set a Meeting Point, just tap on the `Set` button. `Navigate` takes you to a map with a route to your destination drawn. If other users in the group are online, their locations will also be shown on the map.
4. If you want to add more members to the group, tap on `Add Members`. Select the friends you want to invite then tap on Done.
5. In the `Location Tracking` tab, you can turn on tracking (sharing location) by tapping on `Start Tracking`. Tap on the `AR` button to jump into AR view.

### AR
1. If prompted, grant the requested permissions.
2. On the HUD (heads-up display), you can see your heading, what your selected target is (a user, or the destination), the distance to the target, and buttons to change between which target you want the HUD to display.
3. Annotations will be rendered (drawn) for all users of the group with location data and the destination, regardless of which target is selected in the HUD.
4. To exit, simply use the Back button of your device.
